# most repeated word 
**Determine the most repeated word in given string.**

**Rules:**
1.  The word is defined as something separated by spaces without punctuation included.
`list of possible punctuations: "\\n\\t\\r.,;:!?()"`
2.  The uppercase and lowercase version of a word should be counted as same
3.  If two words are repeated an equal number of times, whichever came first should be returned.
4.  Take out common words so they don't count as part of the repetition.
`List of common words: {"the", "a", "or", "an", "it", "and", "but", "is", "are", "of", "on", "to", "was", "were", "in", "that", "i", "your", "his", "their", "her", "you", "me", "all"}`
